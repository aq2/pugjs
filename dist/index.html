        <h2>What is Ayurvedic Yoga Massage??</h2>
        <p>
          Ayurvedic Yoga Massage has its origins in India and is an ancient healing system
          that uses an effective combination of powerful deep tissue massage with coordinated
          breath work and yoga stretches.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ayurvedic system stimulates, opens and balances the flow of energy throughout
          the body, assisting in our own natural tendency towards self-healing.
          
        </p>
        <p>Benefits include:
          <ul>
            <li>stress relief</li>
            <li>elimination of toxins</li>
            <li>stimulation of blood circulation</li>
            <li>
              muscular/skeletal realignment leading to improved posture, digestion,
              and increased flexibility

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Saghar (Nasrien) Amozgar, Persian in origin.  I came to the UK in 2000 after 8 years
          of study in India, completing my PhD in Psychology and my journey of discovery into yoga,
          meditation, and traditional ayurvedic massage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied Ayurvedic Yoga Massage under the expert guidance of Swami Varidi, who trained
          with the renowned Kusum Modak herself.  I qualified in Pune 1999.  I continued to work
          closely with Swami Varidi, organising his courses in Europe and assisting him with their
          delivery in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was fortunate to study in Pune City in the neighbourhood of the Iyengar ashram.  My
          learning and understanding of yoga continued with my qualification from the Sivananda yoga
          center in Kerala, India in 2004.  Since then I have been teaching many classes including
          Muslim women community centres, children and open classes for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I established the Ayurvedic Yoga Association in 2004.  My passion is sharing my
          experiences and insights gained over the years of body-work, not only through my
          therapeutic work with individuals, but also by running regular workshops and
          professional standard training courses for practitioners to spread this wonderful
          ancient technique around the globe.

            A massage with Saghar is a very special experience. She has an extraordinary
            talent for 'reading' the body and what it needs, and her massage is truly healing
            on both a physical and a psychological level.
