      Ayurvedic Yoga Massage is a deep-tissue massage which takes place on a floor mattress.
      It involves deep strokes and a series of yoga stretches to help to eliminate toxins and
      to rejuvenate the body.
    p In Ayurvedic Yoga Massage we use both the feet and the hands.

      One of the best things is using calamus powder which helps to stimulate, and is good
      for blood circulation.

      I am an Ayurveda practitioner myself, and in a moment of need, when acupuncture or physiotherapy
      were not helping my situation, I asked Saghar to have a series of focused massages to heal. After
      two massages only, my foot and my elbow, after six months of pain, were immediately better, and I
      realized that Saghar can deliver the real core of Ayurveda practice in a majestic way! Deep gratitude.

      After massages around the world over the years it is wonderful to actually find one of the best massages
      in my locality. Saghar's massage is not weak or general in any way, but specific and strong leaving your
      body both relaxed and rejuvenated.
